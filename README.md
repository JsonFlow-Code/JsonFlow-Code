# JsonFlow-Code
# JSONFlow: The Universal Language Parser & Programming Language

## Overview

**JSONFlow** is a groundbreaking open-source project designed to be the universal "middle layer" for building interoperable systems across blockchains, AI/LLMs, quantum computing, and modern front-end and back-end applications. JSONFlow enables developers and domain experts to define complex workflows, smart contracts, and integrations using a single, extensible, human- and machine-readable language.

JSONFlow is not just a schema or a DSL—it's a **universal programming language and parser** that bridges the gap between natural language, code, and execution across heterogeneous platforms.

## Key Features

- **Universal Workflow Language:** Define business logic, smart contracts, AI/ML pipelines, quantum circuits, and UI flows in one schema.
- **Middle-Out Architecture:** Build front-end and back-end systems from a single source of truth, enabling true full-stack code generation.
- **Natural Language & LLM Integration:** Supports natural language annotations, localization, and LLM-driven code synthesis and validation.
- **Blockchain Native:** First-class support for Solidity, Cairo, Rust, Go, and more. Generate and verify smart contracts from the same workflow.
- **Quantum Ready:** Express quantum circuits and algorithms alongside classical logic.
- **Extensible & Secure:** Add custom step types, invariants, and access policies. Formal verification and audit trails built in.
- **Interoperability:** Generate code for multiple languages and platforms (Solidity, Rust, Python, TypeScript, etc.) from a single JSONFlow file.
- **UI as Code:** React/Next.js UI configuration is part of the workflow, enabling automatic full-stack app generation.

## Why JSONFlow?

- **Bridges Natural Language and Code:** Write workflows in a way that both humans and machines understand.
- **True Interoperability:** One workflow, many targets—no more rewriting logic for each chain, backend, or frontend.
- **Formal Verification & Security:** Invariants, tests, and audit trails are first-class citizens.
- **Future-Proof:** Designed for today's and tomorrow's platforms—blockchain, AI, quantum, and beyond.

# Architecture
- **1. Schema-Driven
JSON Schema defines the structure, types, and constraints.
Supports inputs, outputs, context, steps, invariants, tests, UI, and more.
- **2. Parser & Code Generators
Parser: Converts JSONFlow into an intermediate representation (IR).
Generators: Emit code for Solidity, Rust, Python, TypeScript, Cairo, Go, Java, Kotlin, etc.
UI Generator: Builds React/Next.js components directly from workflow.
- **3. Middle-Out Build
Single Source of Truth: Define once, generate everywhere.
Front-End: UI config and validation auto-generated.
Back-End: API, server logic, and smart contracts generated from same workflow.
Blockchain/Quantum/AI: Specialized steps for each domain.


# Getting Started
- **1. Install JSONFlow CLI
pip install jsonflow
# or clone and install from source
- **2. Author a Workflow
Create a file transfer_with_kyc.jsonflow using the schema above.

- **3. Generate Code
jsonflow generate --input transfer_with_kyc.jsonflow --target solidity
jsonflow generate --input transfer_with_kyc.jsonflow --target rust
jsonflow generate --input transfer_with_kyc.jsonflow --target typescript
- **4. Build UI
jsonflow generate-ui --input transfer_with_kyc.jsonflow --target react
Advanced Features
Formal Verification: Add invariants and property-based tests; integrate with Certora, Scribble, etc.
Audit Trail: Every change is tracked for compliance and security.
Secrets Management: Reference secrets from vaults or environment.
Quantum Integration: Express quantum circuits and algorithms natively.
AI/LLM Steps: Call out to LLMs or AI models as part of the workflow.
